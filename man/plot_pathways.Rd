\arguments{
\item{enriched_results}{Tibble of results from the function
\code{enrich_pathway}}

\item{columns}{Number of columns to split the pathways across, especially if
there are many pathways. Can specify up to 3 columns, with a default of 1.}

\item{specific_top_pathways}{Only plot pathways from a specific vector of
"top_pathways". Defaults to "any" which includes all pathway results.}

\item{specific_pathways}{Only plot specific pathways. Defaults to "any".}

\item{name_width}{How many characters to show for pathway name before
truncating? Defaults to 35.}

\item{name_rows}{How much to rows to wrap across for the pathway name?
Defaults to 1.}

\item{x_angle}{Angle of x axis labels, set to "angled" (45 degrees),
"horizontal" (0 degrees), or "vertical" (90 degrees).}

\item{max_pval}{P values below "10 ^ -max_pval" will be set to that value}

\item{intercepts}{Add vertical lines to separate different groupings, is a
vector of intercepts (e.g. c(1.5, 2.5)). Defaults to "NA".}

\item{include_gene_ratio}{Boolean; should be plotted? If so, then it is
attributed to the size of the triangles.}

\item{size}{Size of points if not scaling to gene ratio. Defaults to 5.}

\item{legend_multiply}{Size of the legend, e.g. increase if there are a lot
of pathways which makes the legend small and unreadable by comparison.
Defaults to 1, i.e. no increase in legend size.}

\item{show_num_genes}{Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Show the number of genes
for each comparison as brackets under the comparison's name.}

\item{pathway_position}{Whether to have the y-axis labels (pathway names) on
the left or right side. Default is "right".}

\item{new_group_names}{If you want to change the names of the comparisons
to different names. Input a vector in the order as they appear.}

A ggplot object

\description{
Creates a plot to visualize and compare Reactome pathway
enrichment results from multiple DE comparisons. Can split input genes into
up- and down-regulated based on fold change, and automatically assigned
each pathway into an informative top-level category.
