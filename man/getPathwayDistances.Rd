\usage{
getPathwayDistances(pathwayData = sigoraDatabase, distMethod = "jaccard")
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayData}{Three column-data frame of pathways and their constituent
genes. Defaults to the provided \code{sigoraDatabase} object. Must contain
Ensembl gene IDs in the first column, pathway IDs in the second, and
pathway descriptions in the third.}

\item{distMethod}{Character; method used to determine pairwise pathway
distances. Can be any option supported by \code{vegan::vegdist()}.}
}
\value{
Matrix of the pairwise pathway distances (dissimilarity) based on
overlap of their constituent genes.
}
\description{
Given a data frame of pathways and their member genes, calculate
the pairwise distances using a constructed identity matrix.
