  inputList,
  pathName = NA,
  pathId = NA,

  titleSize = 14,
  genesToPlot = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{inputList}{List of data frames of DESeq2 results. The list names are
used as the comparison name for each dataframe (e.g. COVID vs Healthy).
Data frames should have Ensembl gene IDs as rownames.}

\item{pathName}{The name of a Reactome pathway to pull genes from, also used
for the plot title}

\item{pathId}{ID of a Reactome pathway to pull genes from. Alternative to
\code{pathName}.}

\item{manualTitle}{Provide your own title, and override the use of a pathway
name}

\item{titleSize}{Font size for title}

\item{genesToPlot}{Provide a vector of genes you want to plot instead of
pulling the genes from a pathway}

\item{geneFormat}{Default is Ensembl gene IDs ("ensg"), can also input a
vector of HGNC symbols ("hgnc")}

\item{pCutoff}{P value cutoff, default is p<0.05}

\item{fcCutoff}{Absolute fold change cutoff, default is FC>1.5}

\item{plotSignificantOnly}{Boolean (TRUE). Only plot genes that are
differentially expressed (i.e. they pass \code{pCutoff} and \code{fcCutoff}) in
any comparison.}

\item{showStars}{Boolean (TRUE) show significance stars on the heatmap}

\item{hideNonsigFC}{Boolean (TRUE) If a gene is significant in one
comparison but not in another, this will set the colour of the non-
significant gene as grey to visually emphasize the significant genes. If
set to FALSE, it will set the colour to the fold change, and if the p
value passes \code{pCutoff}, it will also display the p value (the asterisks
will be grey instead of black).}

\item{vjust}{Adjustment of the position of the significance stars. Default
is 0.75. May need to adjust if there are many genes.}

\item{rot}{Rotation of the position of the significance stars. Default is 0.}

\item{invert}{Boolean (FALSE). The default plots genes as rows and
comparisons as columns, so setting this to TRUE will place genes as columns
and comparisons as rows.}

\item{log2FoldChange}{Boolean (FALSE). Default plots the fold changes in the
legend as the true fold change, set to TRUE if you want log2 fold change.}

\item{colSplit}{Split each condition into groups for better visualization. To
do so, create a vector where each item of the vector corresponds to which
group the dataframe belongs to in \code{inputList}. E.g. ('Positive',
'Positive', "Negative", "Negative", "Time", "Time"). The order of these
groups is set in the order they appear; if you want to change the order,
change the order of data frames in \code{inputList} and write \code{colSplit}
in the order you want. Order will be ignored if \code{clusterColumns} is set
to TRUE.}

\item{clusterRows}{Boolean (TRUE). Whether to cluster the rows (genes). May
need to change if \code{invert = TRUE}.}

\item{clusterColumns}{Boolean (FALSE). Whether to cluster the columns
(comparisons). Will override order of \code{colSplit} if set to TRUE.}

\item{colAngle}{Angle of column text. Defaults to 90.}

\item{colCenter}{Whether to center column text. Default is TRUE, should set
to FALSE if angled column name (e.g. \code{colAngle = 45}).}

\item{rowAngle}{angle of row text, defaults to 0.}

\item{rowCenter}{whether to center column text. Default is FALSE, should set
to TRUE if vertical column name (e.g. \code{rowAngle = 90}).}
