\arguments{
\item{input_list}{List of data frames of DESeq2 results. The list names
are used as the comparison for each dataframe (e.g. COVID vs Healthy). Data
frames should have Ensembl gene IDs as rownames.}

\item{path_name}{Name of pathway to pull genes from, will be plot title}

\item{path_id}{ID of pathway to pull genes from, if path_name is not given}

\item{manual_title}{Set this as your title instead of pathway name}

\item{title_size}{Font size for title}

\item{genes_to_plot}{Set if you want a specific vector of genes instead of
pulling from a pathway}

\item{gene_format}{Default is Ensembl gene IDs ("ensg"), can also input a
vector of HGNC symbols ("hgnc")}

\item{p_cutoff}{P value cutoff. Default is p < 0.05}

\item{fc_cutoff}{Fold change cutoff. Default is |FC| > 1.5}

\item{plot_significant_only}{Boolean (TRUE) Only plot genes that are
differentially expressed (pass p_cutoff and fc_cutoff) in any comparison}

\item{hide_low_fc}{Boolean (TRUE) If a gene is significant in one comparison
but not in another, this will set the colour of the non-significant gene
as grey to visually emphasize the significant genes. If set to FALSE, it
will set the colour to the fold change, and if the p value passes p_cutoff,
it will also display the p value (the asterisks will be grey instead of
black).}

\item{vjust}{Adjustment of the position of the significance stars. Default is
0.75. May need to adjust if there are many genes}

\item{rot}{Rotation of the position of the significance stars. Default is 0}

\item{invert}{Boolean (FALSE) Default plots genes as rows and conditions as
columns, set to TRUE if you want genes as columns and conditions as rows}

\item{log2_foldchange}{Boolean (FALSE) Default plots the fold changes in the
legend as the true fold change, set to TRUE if you want log2 fold change}

\item{col_split}{Split each condition into groups for better visualization.
To do so, create a vector where each item of the vector corresponds to
which group the dataframe belongs to in input_list. E.g. ('Positive',
'Positive', "Negative", "Negative", "Time", "Time"). The order of these
groups is set in the order they appear; if you want to change the order,
change the order of dataframes in input_list and write col_split in the
order you want. Order will be ignored if cluster_columns is set to TRUE}

\item{cluster_rows}{Boolean (TRUE) Whether to cluster the rows (genes). May
need to change if invert = TRUE.}

\item{cluster_columns}{Boolean (FALSE) Whether to cluster the columns
(conditions). Will override order of col_split if set to TRUE.}

\item{col_angle}{angle of column text. Set default to 90}

\item{col_center}{whether to center column text. Default is TRUE, should set
to FALSE if angled column name (e.g. col_angle = 45)}

\item{row_angle}{angle of row text. Set default to 0}

\item{row_center}{whether to center column text. Default is FALSE, should set
to TRUE if vertical column name (e.g. row_angle = 90)}
