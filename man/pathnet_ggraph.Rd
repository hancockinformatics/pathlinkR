\usage{
pathnet_ggraph(
  network,
  net_layout = "nicely",
  node_size_range = c(4, 8),
  edge_colour = "grey30",
  edge_alpha = 1,
  edge_width_range = c(0.33, 3),
  label_prop = 0.25,
  node_label_size = 5,
  node_label_alpha = 0.67,
  node_label_overlaps = 6,
  seg_colour = "black",
  theme_base_size = 16
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{Tidygraph network object, output from \code{create_pathnet}. See
Details for specific requirements.}

\item{net_layout}{Desired layout for the network visualization. Defaults to
"nicely", but supports any method found in \code{?layout_tbl_graph_igraph}}

\item{node_size_range}{Size range for nodes, mapped to significance
(Bonferroni p-value). Defaults to \code{c(4, 8)}.}

\item{edge_colour}{Colour of network edges; defaults to "grey30".}

\item{edge_alpha}{Alpha value for edges; defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{edge_width_range}{Range of edge widths, mapped to
\code{log10(similarity)}. Defaults to \code{c(0.33, 3)}.}

\item{label_prop}{Proportion of "interactor" (i.e. non-enriched) pathways
that the function will attempt to label. E.g. setting this to 0.5 (the
default) means half of the non-enriched pathways will \emph{potentially} be
labeled - it won't be exact because the node labeling is done with
\code{ggrepel}.}

\item{node_label_size}{Size of node labels; defaults to 5.}

\item{node_label_alpha}{Transparency of node labels. Defaults to \code{0.67}.}

\item{node_label_overlaps}{Max overlaps for node labels, from \code{ggrepel}.
Defaults to \code{6}.}

\item{seg_colour}{Colour of line segments connecting labels to nodes.
Defaults to "black".}

\item{theme_base_size}{Base font size for all plot elements. Defaults to
\code{16}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "gg"
}
\description{
Plots the network object generated from \code{create_pathnet}
}
\details{
A note regarding node labels: The function tries to prioritize
labeling enriched pathways (filled nodes), with the \code{label_prop} argument
determining roughly how many of the remaining interactor pathways might get
labels. You'll likely need to tweak this value, and try different seeds, to
get the desired effect.
