}
\arguments{
\item{deseq_result_list}{list of data frames of DESeq2 results. The list names
are used as the comparison for each dataframe (e.g. COVID vs Healthy). Data
frames should have Ensembl gene IDs as rownames.}

\item{p_cutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff, defaults to < 0.05.}

\item{fc_cutoff}{Absolute fold change, defaults to |FC| > 1.5.}

\item{split}{Boolean (TRUE); Split into up and down-regulated DEGs and do
enrichment separately}

\item{analysis}{Default is SIGORA ("sigora"), others: ReactomePA
("reactomepa"), mSigDB Hallmark gene sets ("hallmark")}

\item{gps_repo}{Gene Pair Signature object for Sigora to use to test for
enriched pathways. We recommend using the one which ships with Sigora,
which can be loaded via \code{data(reaH, package = "sigora")}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of pathway enrichment results
