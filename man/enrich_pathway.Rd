\usage{
enrich_pathway(
  input_list,
  filter = FALSE,
  p_cutoff = 0.05,
  fc_cutoff = 1.5,
  split = TRUE,
  analysis = "sigora",
  gps_repo = reaH,
  gene_universe = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_list}{list of data frames of DESeq2 results. The list names
are used as the comparison for each dataframe (e.g. COVID vs Healthy). Data
frames should have Ensembl gene IDs as rownames.}

\item{filter}{If providing list of data frames containing the unfiltered
output from \code{DESeq2::results()}, set this to TRUE to filter for DE genes
using the thresholds set by the \code{p_cutoff} and \code{fc_cutoff} arguments. When
FALSE (the default) its assumed your passing the filtered results into
\code{input_list}.}

\item{p_cutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff, defaults to < 0.05.}

\item{fc_cutoff}{Absolute fold change, defaults to |FC| > 1.5.}

\item{split}{Boolean (TRUE); Split into up and down-regulated DEGs and do
enrichment separately}

\item{analysis}{Default is SIGORA ("sigora"), others: ReactomePA
("reactomepa"), mSigDB Hallmark gene sets ("hallmark")}

\item{gps_repo}{Gene Pair Signature object for Sigora to use to test for
enriched pathways. We recommend using the one which ships with Sigora,
which is already loaded as "reaH".}

\item{gene_universe}{Optional. Set of background genes to use when testing
with ReactomePA or Hallmark gene sets. For ReactomePA this must be a
character vector of Entrez genes. For Hallmark, it must be Ensembl IDs.}
