\usage{
get_pathway_distances(pathway_data = sigora_database, dist_method = "jaccard")
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_data}{Three column-data frame of pathways and their constituent
genes. Defaults to the provided \code{sigora_database} object. Must contain
Ensembl gene IDs in the first column, pathway IDs in the second, and
pathway descriptions in the third.}

\item{dist_method}{Character; method used to determine pairwise pathway
distances. Can be any option supported by \code{vegan::vegdist()}.}
}
\value{
Matrix of the pairwise pathway distances (dissimilarity) based on
overlap of their constituent genes.
}
\description{
Given a data frame of pathways and their member genes, calculate
the pairwise distances using a constructed identity matrix.
}
\references{
None.
