\title{A data frame containing human PPI data from InnateDB, from the entry
"All Experimentally Validated Interactions (updated weekly)" at
\url{https://innatedb.com/redirect.do?go=downloadImported}.
A few important steps have been taken to filter the data, namely the removal
of duplicate interactions, and removing interactions that have the same
components but are swapped between A and B.}
\format{
A data frame (tibble) with 152,256 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{ensemblGeneA}{Ensembl gene ID for the first gene/protein in the
interaction}
\item{ensemblGeneB}{Ensembl gene ID for the second gene/protein in the
interaction}
}

\usage{
innateDbPPI
}
\value{
An object of class "tbl", "tbl.df", "data.frame"
