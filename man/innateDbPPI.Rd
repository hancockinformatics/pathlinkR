\description{
A data frame containing human PPI data from InnateDB, from the
entry "All Experimentally Validated Interactions (updated weekly)" at
\url{https://innatedb.com/redirect.do?go=downloadImported}. A few important
steps have been taken to filter the data, namely the removal of duplicate
interactions, and removing interactions that have the same components but
are swapped between A and B.
