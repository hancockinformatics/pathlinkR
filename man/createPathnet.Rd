\title{Create a pathway network from enrichment results and a pathway interaction
foundation}
\usage{
createPathnet(enrichPathwayResult, foundation, trim = TRUE, trimOrder = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{enrichPathwayResult}{Data frame of results from Sigora or ReactomePA
(should be based on Reactome data). Must minimally contain the columns
"pathwayId" and "pValueAdjusted".}

\item{foundation}{List of pathway pairs to use in constructing a network.
Typically this will be the output from \code{createFoundation}.}

\item{trim}{Remove independent subgraphs which don't contain any enriched
pathways (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{trimOrder}{Order to use when removing subgraphs; Higher values will
keep more non-enriched pathway nodes. Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A pathway network as a tidygraph object
}
\description{
Creates a tidygraph network object from the provided pathway
information, ready to be visualized with \code{pathnetGGraph} or
\code{pathnetVisNetwork}.
}
\details{
With the "trim" option enabled, nodes (pathways) and subgraphs which
are not sufficiently connected to enriched pathways will be removed. How
aggressively this is done can be controlled via the \code{trimOrder} argument,
and the optimal value will depend on the number of enriched pathways and
the number of interacting pathways (i.e. number of rows in "foundation").
