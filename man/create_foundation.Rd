\usage{
create_foundation(mat, cutoff = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Matrix of distances between pathways (i.e. 0 means two pathways
are identical).}

\item{cutoff}{Distance cutoff used to determine if two pathways should share
an edge.}
}
\value{
A tibble
}
\description{
From a n by n distance matrix, generate a three column tibble to
use in constructing a pathway network. The cutoff can be adjusted to have
more or fewer edges in the final network, depending on the number of
pathways involved.
