\usage{
create_foundation(mat, max_distance = NA, prop_to_keep = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Matrix of distances between pathways (i.e. 0 means two pathways
are identical).}

\item{max_distance}{Distance cutoff (less than or equal) used to determine if
two pathways should share an edge. Pairs with a distance of 0 are always
removed. One of \code{max_distance} or \code{prop_to_keep} must be provided.}

\item{prop_to_keep}{Top proportion of pathway pairs to keep as edges. One of
\code{max_distance} or \code{prop_to_keep} must be provided.}
}
\value{
A tibble
}
\description{
From a n by n distance matrix, generate a tibble to use in
constructing a pathway network. The cutoff can be adjusted to have more or
fewer edges in the final network, depending on the number of pathways
involved.
