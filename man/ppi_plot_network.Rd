\arguments{
\item{network}{\code{tidygraph} object, output from \code{build_network}}

\item{fill_column}{Tidy-select column for mapping node colour. Designed to
handle continuous numeric mappings (either positive/negative only, or
both), and categorical mappings, plus a special case for displaying fold
changes from, for example, RNA-Seq data. See \code{fill_type} for more details
on how to set this up.}

\item{fill_type}{String denoting type of fill mapping to perform for nodes.
Options are: "fold_change", "two_sided", "one_sided", or "categorical".}

\item{cat_fill_colours}{Colour palette to be used when \code{fill_type} is set
to "categorical." Defaults to "Set1" from RColorBrewer. Will otherwise be
passed as the "values" argument in \code{scale_fill_manual()}.}

\item{layout}{Layout of nodes in the network. Supports all layouts from
\code{ggraph}/\code{igraph}, or a data frame of x and y coordinates for each
node (order matters!).}

\item{legend}{Should a legend be included? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{fontfamily}{Font to use for labels and legend (if present). Defaults to
"Helvetica".}

\item{edge_colour_}{Edge colour, defaults to "grey40"}

\item{edge_alpha_}{Transparency of edges, defaults to 0.5}

\item{edge_width_}{Thickness of edges connecting nodes. Defaults to 0.5}

\item{node_size}{Numeric vector of length two, specifying size range of node
sizes (maps to node degree). Default is \code{c(3, 9)}.}

\item{node_colour}{Colour (stroke or outline) of all nodes in the network.
Defaults to "grey30".}

\item{int_colour}{Fill colour for non-seed nodes, i.e. interactors. Defaults
to "grey70".}

\item{fc_up_col}{Colour to use for up regulated nodes when \code{fill_type} is
set to "fold_change". Defaults to "firebrick3".}

\item{fc_down_col}{Colour to use for down regulated nodes when \code{fill_type}
is set to "fold_change". Defaults to "#188119".}

\item{label}{Boolean, whether labels should be added to nodes. Defaults to
FALSE.}

\item{label_column}{Tidy-select column of the network/data to be used in
labeling nodes. Recommend setting to \code{gene_name}, which contains HGNC
symbols mapped from the input Ensembl IDs via biomaRt.}

\item{label_filter}{Degree filter used to determine which nodes should be
labeled. Defaults to 0. This value can be increased to reduce the number of
node labels, to prevent the network from being too crowded.}

\item{label_size}{Size of node labels, defaults to 5.}

\item{label_colour}{Colour of node labels, defaults to "black"}

\item{hub_colour}{Colour of node labels for hubs. The top 2\% of nodes
(based on calculated hub score) are highlighted with this colour, if
\code{label = TRUE}.}

\item{label_face}{Font face for node labels, defaults to "bold"}

\item{label_padding}{Padding around the label, defaults to 0.25 lines.}

\item{min_seg_length}{Minimum length of lines to be drawn from labels to
points. The default specified here is 0.25, half of the normal default
value.}

\item{subnet}{Logical determining if networks produced by
\code{extract_subnetwork} should be treated as such, or just as a normal network
from \code{build_network}.}

\item{...}{Further parameters can be passed on to \code{ggplot2::theme()}, e.g.
\code{legend.position}}
}

\details{
Any layout supported by ggraph can be specified here - see
\code{?layout_tbl_graph_igraph} for a list of options. Or you can supply a data
frame containing coordinates for each node. The first and second columns
will be used for x and y, respectively. Note that having columns named "x"
and "y" in the input network will generate a warning message when supplying
custom coordinates.

Since this function returns a standard ggplot object, you can tweak the
final appearance using the normal array of ggplot2 function, e.g. \code{labs()}
and \code{theme()} to further customize the final appearance.

The \code{fill_type} argument will determine how the node colour is mapped to
the desired column. "fold_change" represents a special case, where the fill
column is numeric and whose values should be mapped to up (> 0) or down (<
0). "two_sided" and "one_sided" are designed for numeric data that contains
either positive and negative values, or only positive/negative values,
respectively. "categorical" handles any other non-numeric colour mapping,
and uses "Set1" from RColorBrewer.

Node statistics (degree, betweenness, and hub score) are calculated using
the respective functions from the \code{tidygraph} package.

If plotting a network created from the \code{extract_subnetwork} function, the
genes belonging to the extracted pathway (i.e. the contents of the
"gene_id" column in the enrichment results) will be highlighted, instead of
hub nodes. The colour used here can be controlled via the \code{hub_colour}
argument, and this behaviour can be turned off altogether by setting the
\code{subnet} argument to FALSE to return an "standard" network. Additionally,
one can set the "starters" attribute of the network being plotted to a
custom character vector of Ensembl gene IDs, to allow highlighting a custom
selection of nodes.
