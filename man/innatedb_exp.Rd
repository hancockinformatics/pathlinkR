\title{A data frame containing human PPI data from InnateDB, from the entry
"All Experimentally Validated Interactions (updated weekly)" at
\url{https://innatedb.com/redirect.do?go=downloadImported}.
A few important steps have been taken to filter the data, namely the removal
of duplicate interactions, and removing interactions that have the same
components but are swapped between A and B.}
\format{
A data frame with 152259 rows and 4 columns:
\describe{
\item{ensembl_gene_A}{Ensembl gene ID for the first gene/protein in the
interaction}
\item{hgnc_symbol_A}{HGNC symbol for the first gene/protein in the
interaction}
\item{ensembl_gene_B}{Ensembl gene ID for the second gene/protein in the
interaction}
\item{hgnc_symbol_B}{HGNC symbol for the second gene/protein in the
interaction}
}
