\arguments{
\item{enrichResults}{Data frame of results from the function
\code{enrichPathway}}

\item{columns}{Number of columns to split the pathways across, particularly
relevant if there are many significant pathways. Can specify up to 3
columns, with a default of 1.}

\item{specificTopPathways}{Only plot pathways from a specific vector of
"topPathways". Defaults to "any" which includes all pathway results, or see
\code{unique(enrichResults$topPathways)} (i.e. the input)
for possible values.}

\item{specificPathways}{Only plot specific pathways. Defaults to "any".}

\item{colourValues}{Length-two character vector of colours to use for the
scale. Defaults to \code{c("white", "steelblue3")}.}

\item{nameWidth}{How many characters to show for pathway name before
truncating? Defaults to 35.}

\item{nameRows}{How much to rows to wrap across for the pathway name?
Defaults to 1.}

\item{xAngle}{Angle of x axis labels, set to "angled" (45 degrees),
"horizontal" (0 degrees), or "vertical" (90 degrees).}

\item{maxPVal}{P values below \code{10 ^ -maxPVal} will be set to that value.}

\item{intercepts}{Add vertical lines to separate different groupings, by
providing a vector of intercepts (e.g. \code{c(1.5, 2.5)}).
Defaults to \code{NA}.}

\item{includeGeneRatio}{Boolean (FALSE). Should the gene ratio be included as
an aesthetic mapping?If so, then it is attributed to the size of the
triangles.}

\item{size}{Size of points if not scaling to gene ratio. Defaults to 5.}

\item{legendMultiply}{Size of the legend, e.g. increase if there are a lot of
pathways which makes the legend small and unreadable by comparison.
Defaults to 1, i.e. no increase in legend size.}

\item{showNumGenes}{Boolean, defaults to FALSE. Show the number of genes for
each comparison as brackets under the comparison's name.}

\item{pathwayPosition}{Whether to have the y-axis labels (pathway names) on
the left or right side. Default is "right".}

\item{newGroupNames}{If you want to change the names of the comparisons to
different names. Input a vector in the order as they appear.}

\description{
Creates a plot to visualize and compare pathway enrichment
results from multiple DE comparisons. Can automatically assign each
pathway into an informative top-level category.
