\usage{
enrichPathway(
  inputList,
  filterInput = TRUE,
  pCutoff = 0.05,
  fcCutoff = 1.5,
  split = TRUE,
  analysis = "sigora",
  filterResults = "default",
  gpsRepo = reaH,
  geneUniverse = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputList}{list of data frames of DESeq2 results. The list names
are used as the comparison for each dataframe (e.g. COVID vs Healthy). Data
frames must have Ensembl gene IDs as the rownames.}

\item{filterInput}{If providing list of data frames containing the
unfiltered output from \code{DESeq2::results()}, set this to TRUE to filter for
DE genes using the thresholds set by the \code{pCutoff} and \code{fcCutoff}
arguments. When FALSE it's assumed your passing the filtered
results into \code{inputList} and no more filtering will be done.}

\item{pCutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff, defaults to 0.05.}

\item{fcCutoff}{Minimum absolute fold change, defaults to 1.5.}

\item{split}{Boolean (TRUE); Split into up and down-regulated DEGs using the
column "log2FoldChange", and do enrichment separately}

\item{analysis}{Default is "sigora", but can also be "reactomepa" or
"hallmark"}

\item{filterResults}{Should the output be filtered for significance? Use
\code{1} to return the unfiltered results, or any number less than 1 for a
custom p-value cutoff. If \code{default}, the significance cutoff for Sigora
is 0.001, and for ReactomePA or Hallmark is 0.05.}

\item{gpsRepo}{Only applies to \code{analysis = "sigora"}. Gene Pair Signature
object for Sigora to use to test for enriched pathways. We recommend using
the one which ships with Sigora, which is already loaded as "reaH".}

\item{geneUniverse}{Only applies when \code{analysis} is "reactomepa" or
"hallmark". The set of background genes to use when testing with ReactomePA
or Hallmark gene sets. For ReactomePA this must be a character vector of
Entrez genes. For Hallmark, it must be Ensembl IDs.}
}
\value{
A data frame of pathway enrichment results for all input comparisons
}
\description{
This function provides a simple and consistent interface to
three different pathway enrichment tools: Sigora and ReactomePA (which both
test for Reactome pathways), and MSigDB Hallmark gene set enrichment. The
input must be a named list of data frames, which can be pre-filtered or
"raw", in which case the function can filter using user-defined cutoffs.
Column names are expected to comply with those output by
\code{DESeq2::results()} function, namely: padj and log2FoldChange. Rownames are
assumed to contain the input genes to be tested.
