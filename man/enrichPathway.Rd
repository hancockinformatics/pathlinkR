\title{Test significant DE genes from DESeq2 for enriched pathways}
\usage{
enrichPathway(
  inputList,
  filterInput = TRUE,
  pCutoff = 0.05,
  fcCutoff = 1.5,
  split = TRUE,
  analysis = "sigora",
  filterResults = "default",
  gpsRepo = reaH,
  geneUniverse = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputList}{A list of data frames, each the output of
\code{DESeq2::results()}. The list names are used as the comparison for each
dataframe (e.g. "COVID vs Healthy"). Each data frame must have Ensembl gene
IDs as the rownames.}

\item{filterInput}{When providing list of data frames containing the
unfiltered output from \code{DESeq2::results()} (default format), set this to
\code{TRUE} to filter for significant genes using the thresholds set by the
\code{pCutoff} and \code{fcCutoff}. When this argument is \code{FALSE} it's
assumed your passing a pre-filtered data frame to \code{inputList}, and no
more filtering will be done.}

\item{pCutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff, defaults to <0.05}

\item{fcCutoff}{Minimum absolute fold change, defaults to >1.5}

\item{split}{Boolean (TRUE); Split into up and down-regulated DE genes using
the requisite column "log2FoldChange", and do enrichment independently.
Results are combined at the end, with an added "direction" column.}

\item{analysis}{Default is "sigora", but can also be "reactomepa" or
"hallmark"}

\item{filterResults}{Should the output be filtered for significance? Use
\code{1} to return the unfiltered results, or any number less than 1 for a
custom p-value cutoff. If left as \code{default}, the significance cutoff
for Sigora is 0.001, or 0.05 for ReactomePA and Hallmark.}

\item{gpsRepo}{Only applies to \code{analysis="sigora"}. Gene Pair Signature
object for Sigora to use to test for enriched pathways. We recommend using
the one which ships with Sigora, which is provided as "reaH".}

\item{geneUniverse}{Only applies when \code{analysis} is "reactomepa" or
"hallmark". The set of background genes to use when testing with ReactomePA
or Hallmark gene sets. For ReactomePA this must be a character vector of
Entrez genes. For Hallmark, it must be Ensembl IDs.}
}
\value{
A data frame of pathway enrichment results for all input comparisons
}
\description{
This function provides a simple and consistent interface to
three different pathway enrichment tools: Sigora and ReactomePA (which both
test for Reactome pathways), and MSigDB Hallmark gene set enrichment.
}
\details{
The input must be a named list of data frames, which can be
pre-filtered or unfiltered. In the latter case, the function can filter
with user-defined cutoffs. Column names are expected to comply with those
output by \code{DESeq2::results()} function, namely: padj and log2FoldChange.
Rownames are assumed to contain the input Ensembl genes to be tested.
