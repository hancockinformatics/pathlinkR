\title{Construct a PPI network from input genes and InnateDB's database}
\usage{
ppiBuildNetwork(
  df,
  col,
  order,
  hubMeasure = "betweenness",
  ppiData = innateDbExp
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame containing genes of interest}

\item{col}{Column of input genes as Ensembl IDs (character)}

\item{order}{Desired network order. Possible options are "zero" (default),
"first," "minSimple," or "minSteiner."}

\item{hubMeasure}{Character denoting what measure should be used in
determining which nodes to highlight as hubs when plotting the network.
Options include "betweenness" (default), "degree", and "hubscore". These
represent network statistics calculated by their respective
\code{tidygraph::centrality_x}, functions, specifically \code{degree},
\code{betweenness}, and \code{hubscore}.}

\item{ppiData}{Data frame of PPI data; must contain rows of interactions as
pairs of Ensembl gene IDs, with columns named "ensemblGeneA" and
"ensemblGeneB". Defaults to pre-packaged InnateDB PPI data.}
}
\value{
\code{tidygraph} object for plotting or further analysis
}
\description{
Construct a PPI network from input genes and InnateDB's database
}
\details{
The "minSteiner" method is implemented with the \code{SteinerNet}
package.

The "hubMeasure" argument determines how \code{ppiBuildNetwork} assesses
connectedness of nodes in the network, which will be used to highlight nodes
when visualizing with \code{ppiPlotNetwork}. The options are "degree",
"betweenness", or "hubscore". This last option uses the igraph implementation
of the Kleinburg hub centrality score - details on this method can be found
at \code{?igraph::hub_score}.

\examples{

exDEGenes <- dplyr::filter(
    dplyr::as_tibble(tibble::rownames_to_column(
        deseqExampleList[[1]],
        "gene"
    )),
    padj < 0.05,
    abs(log2FoldChange) > log2(1.5)
)

ppiBuildNetwork(
    df = exDEGenes,
    col = "gene",
    order = "zero"
)
