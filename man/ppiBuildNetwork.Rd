\title{Construct a PPI network from input genes and InnateDB's database}
\usage{
ppiBuildNetwork(
  deseqResults,
  filterInput = TRUE,
  pCutoff = 0.05,
  fcCutoff = 1.5,
  order = "zero",
  hubMeasure = "betweenness",
  ppiData = innateDbExp
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deseqResults}{Data frame of DESeq2 results with Ensembl gene IDs as
rownames}

\item{filterInput}{If providing list of data frames containing the
unfiltered output from \code{DESeq2::results()}, set this to TRUE to filter for
DE genes using the thresholds set by the \code{pCutoff} and \code{fcCutoff}
arguments. When FALSE it's assumed your passing the filtered
results into \code{inputList} and no more filtering will be done.}

\item{pCutoff}{Adjusted p value cutoff, defaults to <0.05}

\item{fcCutoff}{Absolute fold change cutoff, defaults to an absolute value
of >1.5}

\item{order}{Desired network order. Possible options are "zero" (default),
"first," "minSimple," or "minSteiner."}

\item{hubMeasure}{Character denoting what measure should be used in
determining which nodes to highlight as hubs when plotting the network.
Options include "betweenness" (default), "degree", and "hubscore". These
represent network statistics calculated by their respective
\code{tidygraph::centrality_x}, functions.}

\item{ppiData}{Data frame of PPI data; must contain rows of interactions as
pairs of Ensembl gene IDs, with columns named "ensemblGeneA" and
"ensemblGeneB". Defaults to pre-packaged InnateDB PPI data.}
}
\value{
\code{tidygraph} object for plotting or further analysis
}
\description{
Creates a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using
data from InnateDB, with options for network order, and filtering input.
}
\details{
The "minSteiner" method is implemented with the \code{SteinerNet}
package.

The "hubMeasure" argument determines how \code{ppiBuildNetwork} assesses
connectedness of nodes in the network, which will be used to highlight
nodes when visualizing with \code{ppiPlotNetwork}. The options are "degree",
"betweenness", or "hubscore". This last option uses the igraph
implementation of the Kleinburg hub centrality score - details on this
method can be found at \code{?igraph::hub_score}.
