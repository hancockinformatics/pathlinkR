\usage{
create_pathnet(sigora_result, foundation, trim = TRUE, trim_order = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigora_result}{Data frame of results from Sigora. Must contain columns
"pathway_id" and "bonferroni".}

\item{foundation}{List of pathway pairs to use in constructing a network,
output from \code{create_foundation}.}

\item{trim}{Remove subgraphs which don't contain any enriched pathways
(default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{trim_order}{Order to use when removing subgraphs; Higher values will
keep more non-enriched pathway nodes. Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A tidygraph network object
}
\description{
Creates a tidygraph network object from the pathway information,
ready to be visualized with \code{plot_pathnet}.
}
\details{
With the "trim" option enabled, nodes (pathways) and subgraphs which
are not sufficiently connected to enriched pathways will be removed. How
aggressively this is done can be controlled via the \code{trim_order} argument.
