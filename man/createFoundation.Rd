\title{Create the foundation for pathway networks}
\usage{
createFoundation(mat, maxDistance = NA, propToKeep = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Matrix of distances between pathways (i.e. 0 means two pathways
are identical). Should match output from \code{getPathwayDistances}}

\item{maxDistance}{Distance cutoff (less than or equal) used to determine if
two pathways should share an edge. Pairs with a distance of 0 are always
removed. One of \code{maxDistance} or \code{propToKeep} must be provided.}

\item{propToKeep}{Top proportion of pathway pairs to keep as edges. One of
\code{maxDistance} or \code{propToKeep} must be provided.}
}
\value{
A tibble of interacting pathway pairs
}
\description{
From a n by n distance matrix, generate a tibble of pathway
interactions to use in constructing a pathway network. The cutoff can be
adjusted to have more or fewer edges in the final network, depending on the
number of pathways involved.
