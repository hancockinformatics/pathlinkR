\title{Extract a subnetwork based on pathway genes}
\usage{
ppiExtractSubnetwork(
  network,
  genes = NULL,
  pathwayEnrichmentResult = NULL,
  pathwayToExtract
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{Input network object; output from \code{ppiBuildNetwork}}

\item{genes}{List of Ensembl gene IDs to use as the starting point to extract
a subnetwork from the initial network. You must provide either the
\code{genes} or \code{pathwayEnrichmentResult} argument.}

\item{pathwayEnrichmentResult}{Pathway enrichment result, output from
\code{ppiEnrichNetwork}. You must provide either \code{genes} or
\code{pathwayEnrichmentResult} argument.}

\item{pathwayToExtract}{Name of the pathway determining what genes (nodes)
are pulled from the input network. Must be present in
\code{pathwayEnrichmentResults}}
}
\value{
A \code{tidygraph} object for plotting or further analysis
}
\description{
Extract a subnetwork based on pathway genes
}
\details{
Uses functions from the igraph package to extract a minimally
connected subnetwork from the starting network, using either a list of
Ensembl genes or genes from an enriched pathway as the basis. To see what
genes were pulled out for the pathway, check \code{attr(x, "starters")}.
}
\examples{
exNetwork <- ppiBuildNetwork(
    deseqResults=deseqExampleList[[1]],
    filterInput=TRUE,
    order="zero"
)

exPathways <- ppiEnrichNetwork(
    network=exNetwork,
    analysis="sigora"
)

ppiExtractSubnetwork(
    network=exNetwork,
    pathwayEnrichmentResult=exPathways,
    pathwayToExtract="Interferon alpha/beta signaling"
)
