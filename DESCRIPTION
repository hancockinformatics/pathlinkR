Description: pathnet is an R package designed to facilitate analysis of RNA-Seq 
    results. Specifically, our aim with pathnet was to provide a number of tools
    which take a list of DE genes and perform different analyses on them, aiding
    with the interpretation of results. Functions are included to perform 
    pathway enrichment, with muliplte databases supported, and tools for 
    visualizing these results. Genes can also be used to create and plot 
    protein-protein interaction networks, all from inside of R.
