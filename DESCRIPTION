Description: Create PPI-style networks from pathways, using overlap between 
  their constituent genes to define interactions/edges. This will allow for 
  visualization of similar pathways based on their underlying genes, instead of
  a category/hierarchy term. One can then overlay the results of pathway 
  enrichment analyses onto this "foundational" network, mapping dysregulation
  and significance onto nodes (pathways) in the network.
